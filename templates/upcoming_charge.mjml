          <p>Hi {{ name }}!</p>

          <p>Almost {{ years_with_word }} ago, you added the {{ add_on_name }} add-on to your Entire.Life calendar! Thank
          you so much for supporting us{{#has_ui}}, and we hope you have enjoyed it as much as we
          enjoy ours. If you haven't checked in on it in a while, this {{ ../years }} year
          anniversary might be a good time{{/has_ui}}. ðŸ˜„</p>

          <p>As it is a yearly subscription, you will be charged ${{ amount }} again on {{ charged_on_day_of_week }}. We hope
          you're still happy to support us, and that this hasn't caught you at an
          inopportune moment. If you need to avoid this charge, you can remove the add-on
          at <a href="https://entire.life/emporium">https://entire.life/emporium</a> (you'll need to sign in). </p>

          <p>The card that our payment provider, Stripe, has on file for you ends with <b>{{ last4 }}</b>.
          If that's correct, great! If not, to successfully help fund Entire.Life and to
          avoid interruption in your enjoyment of this add-on, please update you billing
          info: <a href"https://entire.life/payment">https://entire.life/payment</a> (again, you'll need to sign in).</p>
